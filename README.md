# Mobile Flashcards

This is the Mobile Flashcards project for the fourth project of Udacity's React Nanodegree program. Users will be able to create flashcard "decks" as well as quiz themselves on the deck cards.

## Launching the App
To launch the Mobile Flashcards app using the iOS simulator, run the following commands in terminal from this repository. Command 3 is optional if you prefer to debug with React Native Debugger. NB: be sure to set Expo to debug remotely.

```
cd mobile-flashcards
yarn install
open "rndebugger://set-debugger-loc?host=localhost&port=19001"
yarn start i
```

## Testing
This app has been tested with iPhone 8, iOS 11.3 and works as expected.
